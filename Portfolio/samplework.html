   			<h3>Fact Sheet</h3>
   			<p class="description1">
   				For one of my classes, I was told to research a job that I was interested in pursuing in the future. 
   				Then I had to condense the information that I gathered into a one-page fact sheet of the profession. 
   				I decided to research a trademark lawyer, because I have always been interested in law school as a possible path after college.

   			<p class="description4">

   			</p>
   			<h3>How to Fall in Love</h3>
