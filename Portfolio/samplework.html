   			<h3>Fact Sheet</h3>
   			<p class="description">
   				For one of my classes, I was told to research a job that I was interested in pursuing in the future. 
   				Then I had to condense the information that I gathered into a one-page fact sheet of the profession. 
   				I decided to research a trademark lawyer, because I have always been interested in law school as a possible path after college. 
   			</p>
   			<h3>An Apology</h3>
   			<p class="description">
   				Inspired by Ernest Hemingway's famous short story "Hills Like White Elephants", this is a flash fiction piece that I wrote. 
   				It is set up in a staccato fashion and tells the story of a woman being forced to make a decision that will change her life.  
   			</p>
   			<h3>First Impressions</h3>
   			<p class="description">
   				This piece tells the beginning of a college experience. 
   				After saying goodbye to his parents, Luke, the main character and narrator, meets a weird and eccentric girl named Margo on his first day at college and is immediately infatuated with her. 
   				I have the intention of potentially expanding this into a short, teen fiction book. 
   				It is one of my longer writing pieces that I have done. 
   			</p>
   			<h3>How to Fall in Love</h3>
   			<p class="description">
   				I wrote this piece when I was given the assignment of writing in an untraditional form from one of my English professors. 
   				Set up as a "How to" guide, this tells of a budding romance between two unnamed characters.
