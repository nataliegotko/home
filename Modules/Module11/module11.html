	<h1> Module 11: Scrum/Workshop Report </h1>
	<p>Our scrum team worked really well together. We were all very comfortable with bringing up issues that we were having. For example, I couldn’t figure out how to stack my icon pictures on my Work Sample page, but they helped me figure out how to do it with the use of divs.</p>
	<p>I also helped our team members find outside fonts that they were able to use on their portfolio and how they could implement them into their code. I showed them how to use Google fonts and how to put the connecting link at the top of their html in order for their code to know where to access the font (since it was not a default in html). </p>
	<p>From working in my scrum team, I learned that it’s important to ask specific questions and to show your group what you have tried so far. For most of my issues, it was a quick fix like a spelling error in my code that stopped my CSS from recognizing an element. By showing my team what I had tried and the specific area that I was having issues with, they were able to help me identify the problem and the solution rather than just merely offer something that I had previously tried. However, sometimes the group couldn’t help me figure out answers and I had to turn to the Internet and online html help sources. For example, my group wasn’t aware or experience with z-indexing and I needed to use that to overlay my elements. In this situation, I had to do a lot of outside research and experimenting to get my home page to look like what it does now. Google became my best friend. </p>
	<p>Even though we were allowed to leave early most days after your lectures, oftentimes I stayed after and worked on my portfolio. It was nice to have access to my scrum team and to you when I had specific questions that needed addressing. One of the goals that I set for myself was to do some coding that I had not been taught in Codecademy, which I achieved when I used z-indexing to overlap my header image and my navigation bar on my homepage. I am very happy with how this element looks and proud of myself for taking on the challenge. </p>
	<p>Although I never had to post a question myself, I did use the Internet for a lot of help. First, I used <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3schools</a> which was my main source for any questions that I had. However, I also referred to Codecadamey for the basic things that I was having trouble with when I first began coding (like remembering to use a period for classes in CSS). Lastly, I used the inspect element feature in google chrome to creep on some websites. This really only helped when I was building my image grid that I used on my photography page. </p>
