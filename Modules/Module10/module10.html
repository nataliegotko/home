	<h1> Module 10: Seperation of Content from Design </h1>
	<p>Overall, I have found this class challenging. Having never used or even experimented with coding before this class, I was a little shell-shocked during the first couple of weeks. That being said, I can see how much that I have improved since the first time logging onto Codecademy.  Looking at my markup thus far, I see that although I have made strides in my learning of html and CSS, I still am not an expert (although, like you said, being an expert at such a quick changing field is near to impossible). </p>
	<p> To begin, in my markup, I try to target objects directly without over-using classes or ids. For example, when I want to design my h1, I simply use h1 in my CSS rather than inserting an extra div class or div id in my html code. This has really helped de-clutter my html and has allowed for a smoother CSS process. </p>
    <p> On the other hand, when designing my navigation bar, I may have overdone the classes and ids. When looking at my markup, it is a little confusing. I had to use three different classes because I wanted to have a background bar as a background for my links, as well as space out my links with individual boxes around them. But, despite the extensive space in html that this element takes up, I think that it was the best way to accomplish what I was trying to do.</p>
	<p>Moving forward, I will continue to experiment in Codepen before making official changes to my original markup. I have begun using this technique this week and it has really allowed me to figure out exactly how to control my presentational information. My biggest struggle right now is figuring out how to overlay/stack elements. However, after talking with you about my issue, you advised me to use a z index in CSS and hopefully now, after some much needed research and experimentation, I will be able to figure it out this weekend.
